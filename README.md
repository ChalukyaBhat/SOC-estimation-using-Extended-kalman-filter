INPUT REQUIRED :
- Measured current values
- Measured Terminal voltage values
- Measured Temperature values
- R0, R1, R2, C1, C2 values for the respective battery (These values are a function of temperature and SOC)

A second order RC equivalent circuit is used to estimate state of charge and battery terminal voltage using Extended kalman filter. Extended kalman filter requires two sets of equations:
- State Equation
- Measurement equation

For SOC estimation, The state and measurement equations are as follows:

## State Equation:

In the above expressions,
- k represents time stamp
- i(k) - current at time k
- V1(k) - voltage across R1 
- V2(k) - voltage across R2

## Measurement Equation:

The general representation of State and measurement equations are,

## Steps to perform SOC estimation:

- To perform SOC estimation, The initial guess for SOC, V1 and V2 is provided along with measurement error covariance P, Process error covariance Q, and output covariance R.
- SOC(k+1), V1(k+1) and V2(k+1)  values are calculated from the state equations and corresponding error covariances are calcultaed using the following expression. These are the predicted values [x(k+1)] of time step (k+1). \

- similarly Vt(k+1) is calculated using the measurement equations.
- Kalman gain is calculated using the following expression. \

- Now, the predicted values [x(k+1)] of time step is updated using the following expression, \

- The error covarience "P" of time step (k+1) is also updated , \

- With the updated values of time step (k+1), the values of SOC(k+2), V1(k+2) and V2(k+2) are predicted and the cycle repeats.
